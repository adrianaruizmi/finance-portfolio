## Compound Distributions 

### Overview

The notebook provides a comprehensive comparison of multiple computational approaches for modeling aggregate loss distributions - a fundamental concept in **insurance mathematics**, **risk management**, and **quantitative finance**. This work employs industry-standard methodologies commonly adopted by leading financial institutions and insurance firms to support capital allocation and ensure regulatory compliance.
### Technical Implementation

**Core Mathematical Concepts:**
- **Compound Poisson-Gamma modeling** for aggregate claims analysis
- **Probability generating functions (PGF)** for theoretical foundations  
- **Panjer recursion algorithm** for efficient discrete approximations
- **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** methods for computational optimization
- **Monte Carlo simulation** for validation and benchmarking
- **Tweedie distribution** modeling for exact analytical solutions

**Statistical Methodologies:**
- Frequency-severity modeling with Poisson claim counts (λ = 10)
- Gamma severity distribution parameterization (α = 2, θ = 5)
- Comparative error analysis across multiple numerical methods
- Moment matching and convergence validation
- Performance benchmarking of computational algorithms

### Key Results

The analysis demonstrates **high-precision numerical modeling** with error rates consistently below 3.5% across all methodologies:

- **Panjer Recursion**: 2.14% mean error, 3.23% variance error
- **FFT Methods**: -0.007% mean error, -0.04% variance error  
- **Monte Carlo**: 0.28% mean error, -0.15% variance error
- **Tweedie (Exact)**: Near-zero computational error (< 10⁻⁸)

### Professional Applications

This technical framework directly applies to:
- **Capital adequacy modeling** under Basel III/Solvency II frameworks
- **Value-at-Risk (VaR)** and **Expected Shortfall** calculations  
- **Insurance pricing** and **reserving methodologies**
- **Credit risk aggregation** for portfolio management
- **Operational risk** quantification for regulatory reporting
