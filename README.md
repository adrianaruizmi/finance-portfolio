# Finance-Portfolio
This repository features advanced Python implementations and case studies inspired by leading quantitative finance research. The projects address complex financial problems through robust statistical modeling, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI), with a particular emphasis on real-world applicability and reproducibilityâ€”core competencies valued in quantitative roles.
The exercises cover supervised and unsupervised learning models applied to key quantitative challenges, including:

- Credit risk classification using statistical and ML methods
- Asset valuation through neural networks
- Financial fraud detection and anomaly modeling
- Volatility and risk estimation via GARCH models
- Quantitative modeling of derivatives (European options, Monte Carlo simulations)
- Cryptoasset valuation with time series and sentiment analysis (LSTM, NLP)
- Portfolio construction and optimization, from traditional Markowitz theory to contemporary Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP)
- Hedging strategies and reinforcement learning for dynamic trading and risk management
- Uncertainty quantification and natural language processing for financial forecasting.

Each topic integrates rigorous mathematical explanation and practical examples using real financial data. The repository demonstrates expertise in advanced data analytics, modern ML workflows, and the integration of Python for scalable analysis
